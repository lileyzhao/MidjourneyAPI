# MidjourneyAPI

Welcome to the MidjourneyAPI project repository!

## Project Overview

MidjourneyAPI is an API project designed to support Midjourney services. Our implementation is based on reverse engineering the official Midjourney API, rather than Discord's reverse engineering. This provides better speed, stability, and enhanced functionality.

## Development Progress

- The project is in the early development stage.
- Core features are currently being planned and designed.

Please stay tuned for updates and follow the project for the latest information.
